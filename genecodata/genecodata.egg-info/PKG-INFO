# Development of an ontology for formalizing environmental data, from field to sequencing

(Work in Progress)

- Aims to be as generalistic as possible in order to suit any project involving environmental data
- Based on SOSA for objcets of interest, I-ADOPT for variables
- Includes secondary graphes to describe nested objcts (for example a sampling plot within an agricultural field) or involved living organisms
- UseCase data : Work Package 1 of the DeepImpact project (data + scripts for automatic conversion in RDF and / or AskOmics files)

**Developpers**:
- Marie Lahaye (IGEPP Rennes)
- Alice Mataigne (IRISA Rennes)
